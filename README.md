### 1. 
Find an implementation of the SVM model that offers a capability to adjust key parameters
of the model. Find a classification dataset on Kaggle or UCI.
### 2. 
Train the model using your dataset, and try several values of the penalty parameter C (0.1,
1, 100).
### 3.
Analyze the accuracy and robustness of the algorithm and and propose methods to improve
them.
### 4.
What kind of data will cause the general (standard) SVM classifier to fail, and how can this
problem be mitigated? Does it work well for your dataset?
### 5.
Try to use different kernel functions and see how this influences the accuracy on crossvalidation.
Explain why.
